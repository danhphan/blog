    "In the previous weeks, I focused on implementing the Intrinsic Coregionalization Model (ICM) in PyMC.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the beginning, I've started with a small goal, which is to run an Intrinsic Coregionalization Model (ICM) in PyMC. The main part of codes was already developed in PyMC v3 by Bill Engels (one of my mentors), so I just need to convert the [PyMC v3 notebook](https://github.com/danhphan/gp_experiments/blob/main/experiments/00_mogp_pymc3.ipynb) into a [PyMC v4 notebook](https://github.com/danhphan/gp_experiments/blob/main/experiments/00_mogp_pymc_v4.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next goal is replicating the Coregionalized Regression Model [example notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/GPy/coregionalized_regression_tutorial.ipynb) in GPy. The result if ICM for this dataset is in [this notebook](https://github.com/danhphan/gp_experiments/blob/main/experiments/12_Coregionalized_Regression_Model_GPy_PyMC.ipynb). In addition, the example from GPytorch also be translated into PyMC [here](https://github.com/danhphan/gp_experiments/blob/main/experiments/05_multitask_gp_regression_pymc4_3outputs.ipynb) with 3 dimensional outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What about two or more outputs with real datasets? Using the data sets [here](https://github.com/GAMES-UChile/mogptk/blob/master/examples/example_gold_oil_NASDAQ_USD.ipynb) with 4 outputs: GOLD, OIL, NASDAQ, and USD. It seems to work alright in [this notebook](https://github.com/danhphan/gp_experiments/blob/main/experiments/15_multitask_gp_for_gold_oil_nasdaq_usd.ipynb), but it still needs further improvement. "
