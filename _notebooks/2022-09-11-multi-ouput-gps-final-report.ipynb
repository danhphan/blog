    "- In [Weeks 01-03](https://danhphan.net/blog/gp/gaussian%20process/icm/2022/06/26/multi-ouput-gps-w01-03.html), I've started with a small goal, which is to run an Intrinsic Coregionalization Model (ICM) in PyMC. The main part of codes was already developed in PyMC v3 by Bill Engels (one of my mentors), so I just need to convert the [PyMC v3 notebook](https://github.com/danhphan/gp_experiments/blob/main/experiments/00_mogp_pymc3.ipynb) into a [PyMC v4 notebook](https://github.com/danhphan/gp_experiments/blob/main/experiments/00_mogp_pymc_v4.ipynb).\n",

This follows by proposing several [API options](https://github.com/danhphan/gp_experiments/blob/main/experiments/16_multitask_gp_regression_pymc4_lcm.ipynb) for ICM and LCM.\n",

    "The project allows me to learn more on Gaussian Process (GP), its advantages and also limitations. I think GP has a huge potential for spatial and temporal (time-series) data sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, implementing GP help me further understand on MultiNormal distribution :) Alghough there are still a lot to learn and do. I'm especially interested in learning more on other methods for time-series data, and a comparison on the performance between these models.\n",

    "Finally, I would like to thank the PyMC devs team, especially my mentors [Chris Fonnesbeck](https://github.com/fonnesbeck), and [Bill Engels](https://github.com/bwengals) for their great guidance and supports. I will definitely not able to perform the project without their helps. "
