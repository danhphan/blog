    "- Before moving to Gaussian Process, a Bayesian non-parametric method, one should be familiar with parametric Bayesian models\n",
    "- Firstly, I will start from Richard McElreath's [Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by watching his lecture on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJK6_DZvcMqNSzQdEkzvzA/playlists), reading the book and doing excercises. The homework solution coded in PyMC is [here](https://github.com/gbosquechacon/statrethink_course_in_pymc3) thanks to Gabriel B.C. I prefer Python and PyMC, so I will use the [PyMC implemetation](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-resources/tree/main/Rethinking) of the book.\n",
    "- Secondly, [Bayesian Analysis with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/bayesian-analysis-python-second-edition) (second edition) by Osvaldo Martin is a really good book to learn Bayseian data analysis with PyMC.\n",
    "- Thirdly, [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers): An introduction to Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming. This one really help to know how Bayesian methods are used in different applications.\n",
