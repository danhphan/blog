    "- For the begining, I've started with a small aim is to run an Intrinsic Coregionalization Model (ICM) in PyMC. The main part of code was already developed in PyMC v3 by Bills (one of my mentor), so I just need to convert the [PyMC v3 notebook](https://github.com/danhphan/gp_experiments/blob/main/experiments/00_mogp_pymc3.ipynb) into a [PyMC v4 notebook](https://github.com/danhphan/gp_experiments/blob/main/experiments/00_mogp_pymc_v4.ipynb). \n",
    "- The next goal is to replicate the Coregionalized Regression Model [example notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/GPy/coregionalized_regression_tutorial.ipynb) in GPy. The result is on [this notebook]()."
